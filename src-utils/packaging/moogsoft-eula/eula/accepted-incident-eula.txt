12.3. Each party shall protect and safeguard Confidential Information received from the other to the same degree as it would in respect of its own Confidential Information and in any event shall apply a reasonable standard of care in protecting and safeguarding such Confidential Information.
12.4. The confidentiality obligations in this clause shall not apply to any information which:
12.4.1. is or subsequently becomes available to the general public other than through a breach by the receiving party; or

13. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS INDEMNITY

13.1. Provided always that Customer shall mitigate such damages, costs and expenses to the fullest extent reasonably possible, Moogsoft shall indemnify and hold Customer harmless against any reasonable costs (including legal costs), expenses or damages suffered or incurred by Customer arising out of any claim by a third party that the normal operation, possession or use of the Moog Software by Customer in accordance with this Agreement infringes the copyright or patent rights or trade secrets of such third party, provided that Customer:
13.1.1. gives Moogsoft prompt, written notice of any such claim;
13.1.2. gives Moogsoft control of the defense and/or settlement of such claim and Customer has not taken any action that would compromise Moogsoft's ability to settle or otherwise defend the claim; and
13.1.3. shall reasonably co-operate in any defense or settlement.
13.2. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction upholds a claim of infringement as set out in clause 13.1 or if in Moogsoft's reasonable opinion such claim is likely to be upheld, Moogsoft shall at its option and expense:
13.2.1. obtain for Customer the right to continue using the Licensed Software; or
13.2.2. replace or modify the Licensed Software without materially impairing the operation of the Licensed Software so its use becomes non infringing or otherwise lawful; or
13.2.3. if either of the above cannot be accomplished on reasonable terms (and for the avoidance of doubt such failure shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement), remove the Licensed Software and refund to Customer the total amount paid by Customer under this Agreement for the Licensed Software less a reasonable sum in respect of Customer's use of the Licensed Software to the date of such removal.
13.3. Clauses 13.1 and 13.2 state Moogsoft's entire liability for infringement of third party rights or trade secrets misappropriation.
13.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Moogsoft shall have no liability for any claim of patent or copyright infringement or trade secret misappropriation based upon, or caused by, the operation or use of the Moog Software:
13.4.1. in breach of this Agreement;
13.4.2. on a computer operating system for which it was not designed;

13.4.6. with any processes or concepts owned or used by Customer (whether combined with the Moog Software or otherwise);  
13.4.7. if the infringement or misappropriation would have been avoided by Customer's use of the most current version of the Moog Software; or
13.4.8. which has been modified by anyone other than Moogsoft.

14. NON-SOLICITATION

14.1. Customer shall not (except with the prior written consent of Moogsoft) at any time during the term of this Agreement or for a further period of twelve (12) months after the termination of this Agreement directly or indirectly solicit or entice away (or attempt to solicit or entice away) from the employment of Moogsoft any person employed or engaged by Moogsoft in the performance of this Agreement other than by means of a national advertising campaign open to all comers and not specifically targeted at any of Moogsoft's employees.

15. TERMINATION

15.1. Notwithstanding clause 3, this Agreement may be terminated at any time by notice in writing having immediate effect in any of the following events:
15.1.1. by Moogsoft, if Customer fails to pay any sum payable under this Agreement when due and such sum remains outstanding more than fifteen (15) days after notice from Moogsoft to Customer requiring it to be paid;
15.1.2. by either party, if the other commits any material breach of this Agreement and, in the case of a material breach capable of remedy, fails to remedy the same within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written notice giving particulars of the breach and requiring it to be remedied;
15.1.3. by either party, if the other (i) passes a resolution for winding up (other than for the purposes of solvent amalgamation or reconstruction where the resulting entity is at least as creditworthy as the original entity and assumes all of the obligations of the original entity under this Agreement) or a court shall make an order to that effect; or (ii) ceases to carry on business or substantially the whole of its business; or (iii) becomes or is declared insolvent, or convenes a meeting of or makes or proposes to make any arrangement or composition with its creditors; or (iv) if a liquidator, receiver, administrator, administrative receiver, manager, trustee, or similar officer is appointed over any of its assets or (v) in the event of institution of bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency, reorganization, or other similar proceedings by or against the other party under any section or chapter of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as amended, or under any similar laws or statutes of the United States or any state thereof, if such proceedings have not been dismissed or discharged within thirty (30) calendar days after they are instituted; or the insolvency or making of an assignment for the benefit of creditors or the admittance by either party of any involuntary debts as they mature or the institution of any reorganization arrangement or other readjustment of debt plan of either party not involving the United States Bankruptcy Code.

17. ASSIGNMENT

17.1. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the prior written approval of the other party and any purported assignment in violation of this section shall be void; provided, however, that either party may assign this Agreement in connection with the transfer, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of such party's outstanding voting securities or of all or substantially all of the assets or business of such party (a "Change in Control"); provided, further, that Moogsoft may assign this Agreement to any of its affiliates.

Any mediation will be held in California, USA (where Customer is a non-European entity), or in the UK (where Customer is a European entity).

22.3. If either party fails to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement and the other party fails to enforce the provisions relating thereto, such party's failure to enforce this Agreement shall not prevent its later enforcement.

2.3	Distribution.  If Customer distributes the Configuration Modules to any third party, it shall do so subject to a written license agreement containing terms and conditions that are no less protective of Moogsoft's rights in the Configuration Modules than the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including these Supplementary Product Terms).

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Open Source Software is not licensed under Section 2.1 of these Supplementary Product Terms and instead is separately licensed pursuant to the terms and conditions of their respective open-source software licenses, copies of which are either attached to this Agreement, reproduced in the appropriate readme file, or available on the Moogsoft web site.  Customer agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of such open-source software license agreements.

There are no implied licenses granted under this Agreement, and all rights not expressly granted are reserved.
2.6	Proof of Concept and Evaluation Licenses.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including these Supplementary Product Terms), if Customer has licensed the Other Moogsoft Software under a proof-of-concept or an evaluation license (in other words, such that Section 2 of the main body of the Agreement applies to Customer's use of the Other Moogsoft Software), then (a) Customer may exercise the license rights set forth in Section 2.1 of these Supplementary Product Terms solely for the internal purpose of evaluating and testing the Licensed Software for suitability with Customer's application; and (b) Customer may not distribute the Configuration Modules to any third party.  If Customer wishes to use the Configuration Modules or Module Documentation for any other purpose, Customer must first purchase a Standard License or Enterprise License for the Other Moogsoft Software.
